在推上看到一则Twitter原先的CEO Parag Agrawal 和 Elon Musk之间的通信。

Twitter CEO April 9, 2022 Parag Agrawal:
 You can freely tweet "Is Twitter dying?" or anything else about Twitter, but it is my responsibility to tell you that that is not helping me improve Twitter in the current context. Next time we talk, I'd like you to give me your perspective on the level of internal distraction right now and how it's affecting our ability to work. I hope the AMA helps people get to know you, understand why you believe in Twitter, and trust you. I would like to see the company get to a point where we are more resilient and not distracted, but we are not at that place right now.

Parag的意思大致是说，需要建设性的批评，而不仅仅是简单的指责。
马斯克的回复很简单，只有一句话：

What did you achieve this week?

你这一周的成果/进步是什么？

质问很简单，却振聋发聩。

不敢偷懒，每天完成一个小目标，前进一小步。

很早之前有个同事，在工位上面贴了一张漫画，一头向前顶的犀牛，和一句话：Move a step forward every day.

同事在人品上有点瑕疵，后来没有继续交往。这句话留给我一些感触。
